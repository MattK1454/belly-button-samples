# Belly Button Biodiversity Project

## Overview

Following the successful collection of bacteria samples from multiple volunteers, this site was developed to allow the data to be accessed and displayed in a graphic manner for each volunteer.

## Summary

![Selection field and first two graphs](https://github.com/MattK1454/belly-button-samples/blob/main/images/biodiversity-site.png)

This is a screenshot of the selection field where the id number for each volunteer can be selected. This will auto-generate the first two graphs you see detailing the top ten most collected samples and the frequency with which the volunteer washes their belly button.

The above screen shot is of the auto-generated bubble graph displaying each bacteria sample collected from the volunteer. Each marker's size is determined by the number of samples of each bateria strain collected (i.e. the more collected, the larger the marker).
